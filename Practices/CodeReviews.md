# Code Reviews

The purpose of a peer code review is for one person to choose a piece of code or problem they're trying to tackle,
then have another person sit down with them to go over the code to identify how it could be improved to make it easier to read and maintain.

This process is a sharing of ideas to find ways to increase code quality and development practices by
 - using recommended principles and practices
 - learn new coding techniques
   - Design Patterns
   - Software Architecture
 - expand knowledge of resources, libraries and tools
 - develop effective practices (behaviours and habits)
   - Atomic commits
   - Pull requests
   - Test Driven Development
   - Behaviour Driven Development
   - etc.
It also has added benefits such as improving your ability to communicate ideas.

Whenever you do a code review always give constructive feedback and never personal criticisms (you're reviewing code, not the person).

The booklet _What To Look For In A Code Review_ by Trisha Gee is a good resource for getting inspiration for what things to consider or cover.
