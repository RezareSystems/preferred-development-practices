# C-Sharp Solution Structure

## Creating a new solution

In Visual Studio 2019 a [blank solution][1] (one without any projects) can be created by clicking _Create a new project_,
then searching for _blank solution_ in the _Search for templates_ entry box.
Now follow these next steps.

See:  
[Creating a Blank Solution][1]

### Solution Name

The solution will have a high level name which groups the projects together.
The solution name should follow the [Microsoft naming convention][Microsoft namespace naming conventions] of

```
<Company>.(<Product>|<Technology>)
```

which for a personal project for a browser calculator could be named:

```
Larkins.BrowserCalculator
```
